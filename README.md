### Instructions on how to use the server are provided in this README file.
You can compile the program using "make" into terminal. Config.json file includes the parameters

After configuring the config.json file you can "run" the server by executing the "./s" command 
into terminal, then you can open any browser (Mozilla Firefox , Google Chrome , Safari)
